            Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
            western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
            Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is
            an
            utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended
            life
            forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital
            watches are
            a pretty neat idea.
